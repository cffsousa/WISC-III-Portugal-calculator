A python program to help convert test points into standardized points for the WISC III Inteligence scale for children.

Created the program to help my girlfriend with the process of testing children using the WISC scale. This is my first program ever as I just started  to learn how to program so the code is kind of a mess, but it works.

This should only be used with the portuguese WISC III scale as the values vary from country to country, given that it is used to help determine IQ points.

if it can be of use to you go ahead and give it a try, but you can probably do it more efficently in excel!!
